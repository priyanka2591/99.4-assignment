***************VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT**********************
The colab files have been named after naming convention - "_trialcount_" +  "_number of parameters_" + "_training accuracy_"  + "_validation accuracy_"

1) The assignment has been done in size experiments
2) Firt four experiments (Trial1, trial 2, Trial 3 and trial 4) deal aim to achieve the parameters to less than 10000 with a constant accuracy of 99.4 which has been achieved by trial 4 with 8176 parameters
3) the last experiment trial 6 has achiveved constant accuracy of 99.4 with 7767 parameters. The key to this has been reducing the number of convolutions plus deleting all dropout layers and incorporation of transition layers after every convolutional block.
4) Batch normalization, dropouts and image transformation / augmentation techniques such as normalization and  rotation have been used here.
5) The steps have been explaind sequentially in all the five models. The screenshot of the analytics is shown below.
